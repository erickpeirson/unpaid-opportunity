Hi ECOLOG,


Do you live on the Big Island and are you looking for a summer volunteer opportunity? Or
are you a mainlander looking to visit Hawaii and participate in some forest
conservation field work while you're at it? I am searching for a volunteer
field assistant for the upcoming summer season. I study plant community ecology
on the Big Island and I need someone to help with data collection for ~2 months
this summer. See below for full job description!

Duration: June 15-August 15 (or for any period within these dates!). I
anticipate ~10-hour field days during the week, and plenty of free time on
weekends.

Description: Forest vegetation surveys using both plot and transect methods.
Position will require hiking long distances on and off-trail while carrying
field gear, operating a 4WD vehicle, maintaining good relationships with local
landowners and state/federal agencies, identifying plant species, collecting
soil samples, and potentially some lab work. You'll also have the opportunity to
attend the Hawaii Ecosystems Conference in early July at the University of
Hawaii-Hilo. This is a great event for learning about the research taking place
in Hawaii and networking for future opportunities.

Good qualities to have as an applicant: Problem-solving skills, positive
attitude, floral identification and dichotomous key experience (and a
willingness to learn a new flora), good communication skills, data entry and
management experience, hand-held GPS as well as map and compass navigation
experience, willingness and ability to hike and work in all conditions,
including cold, wet, windy (yes, even in Hawaii).

Funding: If you are traveling from the mainland, I can provide lodging and
transportation (shared) once you get to the island (cannot cover flight costs!).
If you live on the Big Island, I can reimburse the cost of travel to and from
the study site in Kohala or potentially provide transportation and lodging if
needed.

Please send me ([log in to unmask]) a 1-page resume and contact information for
2 references if you are interested! Looking to fill this position as soon as
possible!

Best,

Lisa Schomaker
