Where: Loro Parque Fundacion, Tenerife, Spain
When: Immediately until 31 August
What: Volunteers Research Assistants

The Department of Behavioural Ecology and Evolutionary Genetics at
the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Seewiesen, Bayern, Germany
(see http://www.orn.mpg.de/2622/Department_Kempenaers), is seeking two
volunteers to start working immediately and until 31 August 2016 (the
position requires a minimum of 2 months).

The volunteers will assist in the collection of courtship displays and egg
laying data. This work would be part of a project that aims to understand
the evolution of sexual selection in parrots of the world. The work
will be done at the facilities of the Loro Parque Fundacion, located in
Tenerife, Spain.

Work will include:

·         recording courtship displays
·         following up reproduction (egg laying, hatching, and fledging)
·         maintenance of electronic equipment
·         setting up experimental equipment
·         data collection, entry, and management

Successful candidates should have experience with video-recording
equipment. Experience with monitoring animals is desirable. Applicants
should also be highly motivated and well organised, with capabilities
of working both in a group and independently. Work will be 5-6 days
per week starting early in the morning and potentially continuing into
the evening. The working language at the Institute is English, so good
knowledge of the language is required. A basic working knowledge of the
Spanish language would be advantageous. Eligibility is sadly restricted
to UK and EU students. The Max Planck Institute for Ornithology employs a
dynamic, dedicated, and international group of researchers who are focused
on exploring the fields of evolution, ecology, genetics, and neurobiology.

Benefits will include accommodation and travel-related expenses in Tenerife.

If you are interested in applying for one of the volunteer positions
as described above, please apply (including your CV and cover letter)
via email to lcarballo@orn.mpg.de.

Deadline 20 April 2016 or until the positions are filled.
