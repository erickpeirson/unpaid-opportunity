Hi everyone,

On behalf of the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute (BDRI), I am pleased to
announce that we are currently accepting volunteer applications Â for our
research project along the North-western coast of Spain. There are vacancies
available inÂ September and October 2016 (a minimum of 6 days of
participation).Â Â Volunteers can expect to gain a solid foundation in cetaceans
conservation behaviour with a focus on dolphins ethology, habitat use and
communication. BDRI offers volunteers the chance to work through the many steps
of research. Your participation means that you will not only be observing the
studied animals at sea, but you will also be collecting different types of
scientific data, using various research methods, and helping on board the
research vessel in general. When back in the lab, you will participate in the
transcription of the collected data, with the database work, you will use
various softwares, perform photo-identification analysis, use of GIS and more.Â
Furthermore, as the Galician coastline is known for frequent strandings of
various marine mammals species, you will be a part of an important network for
rescue and data collection from these stranded animals.Â  The BDRI is a private
and self-funded centre, hence, there is no compensation for the volunteering
positions. There is an participation fee that includes the accommodation in an
apartment, tuition and other expenses derived of your participation (housing,
free-wifi, use of equipment, field trips by car, and use of research vessel).
Successful applicants will be responsible for their own transportation expenses
to and from the research centre (O Grove, Galicia, Spain). Â Approved
applications are accepted on a first-come, first serve basis. Prior field
research experience is recommended but not required.Â  Please download the
general information and application form at:
