We are looking for an enthusiastic, motivated candidate for a one-year position working as a field-based
research technician in Gabon, starting July 15, 2016!

The research project focuses on changes in tree community composition influenced by plant-enemies,
ranging from fungal pathogens to large forest mammals. Work includes setting up long-term tree and
seedling census plots, collecting and identifying seeds from seed traps, tracking tree and seedling
growth and survival, recording tree phenology, and quantifying animal species abundances.

Successful candidates must thrive in a small team setting, working well with both Gabonese and
American technicians and guides. Work begins at 8am most days and typically consists of hiking more
than 8 km through hilly and swampy terrain in hot, humid, and buggy conditions. Applicants must be in
good physical condition and be able to carry up to 30 pounds.

The field station is rustic with only intermittent access to internet and telephone. Technicians live
together at the station, with occasional power outages and water shortages. Some fieldwork is done at
more remote sites, requiring technicians living out of a tent for one week of the month.

While working in this challenging environment, candidates will be rewarded with the opportunity to
observe tropical bird and animal species in their natural habitats. Candidates will undoubtedly learn a
great deal about tropical ecology, botany, natural history, and conservation biology, as well as what it
takes to organize projects in Central Africa.

Candidates must have a BS in biology, ecology, botany, or a related field. Those with previous fieldwork
experience will be given preference. French-speaking skills are recommended, though exceptions will
be made for experienced candidates, especially those who have worked in the Tropics.

This is an unpaid position. Research assistants will be provided room and board at the Ipassa Research
Station and travel within country is paid. Research assistants must pay their travel to Gabon, but will be
reimbursed upon successful completion of their one-year term.

Interested persons should send: 1) a CV; 2) a cover letter describing motivation and qualifications for
position; and 3) the names and contact information of three professional references. Please send
application materials in pdf form to [log in to unmask] with the subject line "(candidate's last
name)-Ipassa Field Position." Ex: Smith-Ipassa Field Position. Applications will be accepted until June
18, 2016.
