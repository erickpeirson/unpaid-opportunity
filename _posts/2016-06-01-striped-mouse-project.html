summary: "Unfortunately no funding is available for field assistants, who have
    to cover all costs by themselves. Students have to arrange their own transport
    to the field site (for details how to do this see below). A monthly fee of
    approx R 1500 for field assistants (approx 100 Euro) must be paid to the
    research station for accommodation. Students must buy their food etc for
    themselves (approx. R 3000 or 200 Euro per month). You might have extra costs,
    such as going to the restaurant / take away on town days, beer or wine, shopping
    for clothes etc., postage and telephone calls home. These can easily be another
    100 Euro / month. Including accommodation and groceries costs of approx. 300-400
    Euro / month should be expected."

Costs
Unfortunately no funding is available for field assistants, who have to cover
all costs by themselves. Students have to arrange their own transport to the
field site (for details how to do this see below). A monthly fee of approx R
1500 for field assistants (approx 100 Euro) must be paid to the research station
for accommodation. Students must buy their food etc for themselves (approx. R
3000 or 200 Euro per month). You might have extra costs, such as going to the
restaurant / take away on town days, beer or wine, shopping for clothes etc.,
postage and telephone calls home. These can easily be another 100 Euro / month.
Including accommodation and groceries costs of approx. 300-400 Euro / month
should be expected.

Duration and period Volunteers have to stay a minimum of 2 months, though longer
periods are preferred. Due to the visa laws of South Africa, visas for more than
3 months can only be obtained as a research visa, for which you need a letter
from your university (details here). We are looking for volunteers during all
periods of the year. Work of field assistants Trapping and marking of small
mammals. Radio-tracking: Mice will be equipped with radio tags and tracked in
the field to determine home ranges and nest sites. Direct observations: The open
habitat in the Succulent Karoo enables direct behavioral observations in the
field. Social interactions, home range use and feeding habits will be recorded.
Experiments and observations with captive specimen under natural weather
conditions. Maintenance and cleaning of the research station. What kind of
people are needed as field assistants: Biology/zoology/veterinary students are
preferred as candidates. Applicants must have an interest to working in the
field and with animals. Whereas the research is mainly non-invasive, this is no
job for extreme animal right persons. We take tissue samples (tail tip),
sometimes blood samples, and mice from the captive colony often have to be
euthanized for colony management reasons. Applicants must be able to manage
extreme temperatures (below zero at night, sometimes over 40 degrees Celsius
during days). Hard working conditions will await applicants, as the study
species get up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o` clock), and stop their activity
with dawn. Work during nights might also be necessary. Work in the field will be
done for 5-6 days a week. Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the field and to be part of a small social group at
the research station. Applicants are expected to read through the relevant
literature regarding the study species/ study area before they start to
volunteer. Experience in animal behavioral is of advantage.

How to become a field assistant People interested in working as a field
assistant for 2-12 months apply via email. Please write a short (1 page)
motivation, state for which period you would be available, and attach a CV. Send
your email to: succulent.karoo.research.station@kabelbw.de.
