TWO field assistants needed for a study of ecology of colonial, cooperative
breeding and foraging behavior in the Hispaniolan Woodpecker in the
Dominican Republic. Field research assistants will participate in data
collection during an intensive ~3.5-month field season. Assistant duties
will include (but are not limited to) nest monitoring, focal behavioral
observations (including nest watches and foraging records), assisting with
tree-climbing, color-band reading, nest-searching, assisting with bird
capture and processing, and data entry. I am currently looking for:

TWO (2nd term) half-term assistants are needed to arrive between 15 and 30
April (flexible) and remain until 30 July. Applications will be accepted
until positions are filled, but preference will be given to those submitted
by 26 March.

Location: Piedra Blanca (near Jarabacoa and close to Salto Jimenoa I), La
Vega province, Dominican Republic

Job description: The Hispaniolan Woodpecker (Melanerpes striatus) nests
colonially, ranging from 2 to as many as 20+ simultaneously active nests in
the same tree, making it very unique among woodpeckers (only one other
picid species of the more than 200 is known to nest in colonies).
Additionally, the Hispaniolan Woodpecker is the most sexually size
dimorphic of Melanerpes woodpeckers. Since 2012, I have been color-banding
and observing these woodpeckers to better understand the social
organization of colonies. Fieldwork in the 2016 field season will focus on
further studying social organization of colonies, attempting to answer such
questions as:

1) How do nesting substrate (live vs. dead trees) and its availability
influence colony size and structure?

2) What information do prospecting birds utilize to "decide" where to nest,
and how does this information use influence variation in colony size?

More generally, we will collect data to help test hypotheses regarding the
costs, benefits, and consequences of group living, the operation of sexual
selection in cooperative societies, and the evolutionary factors driving
the woodpecker's exceptional size dimorphism. An important secondary
objective of our work will be studying how parasitic fly larvae in the
genus Philornis impact nesting success.

Field research assistants will participate in data collection during an
intensive 3.5-month field season. Assistant duties will include (but are
not limited to) nest monitoring, focal behavioral observations (including
nest watches, dominance watches, and foraging records), assisting with
tree-climbing, color-band reading, nest-searching, assisting with bird
capture and processing (including metal- and color-banding), and data
management and entry. All volunteers will have the opportunity to learn
various tree-climbing techniques. Assistants will be trained to set up,
operate, and take down a unique elevated mist-net system developed
specifically for this project but with applications to other ornithological
studies.

Days will be long and the work will be physically and mentally demanding,
but for those seeking to gain experience in field research, you won=A2t be
disappointed. The workweek will typically be 6 days long in humid,
mosquito-filled fields and forests, involving hiking sometimes muddy, steep
hills, climbing barbed-wire fences, and avoiding bulls; this work will
leave you exhausted at the end of the day! Assistants will be involved in
all aspects of the project, including discussions of the conceptual
framework of the project.

Neotropical bird species are generally poorly known with many aspects of
their natural history incomplete or wholly unknown. Hispaniola is an island
with many poorly known native or endemic species that will reveal their
intriguing secrets to those motivated and patient enough to look. While our
work will focus primarily on Hispaniolan Woodpecker, opportunities to
collect data on the island=A2s other avian denizens may arise, and we will
exploit these opportunities when possible. Any such observations of other
bird species made by field assistants may result in publications (so an
added bonus of this fieldwork is the possibility of not only adding a
publication to your CV but making a real contribution to our knowledge of
Hispaniolan birds and Neotropical ornithology). That having been said, the
woodpecker research takes priority.

Dates:

Spring/summer assistants- Start: ~15 April, End: ~30 July 2016. (~3 months)

College graduates and undergraduates are encouraged to apply. Current
college students are encouraged to apply for academic credit for their work
at their home institution.

Salary: Housing, drinking water, and research-related travel within the
Dominican Republic will be covered.

Additionally, some funding is available to partly or fully cover airfare
to/from the Dominican Republic. Assistants will have to cover their food
expenses (~$30 USD per week).

Deadline: Until positions are filled. Preference will be given to those
submitted by 26 March.

I'm eager to fill these positions as soon as possible as these vacancies
arose unexpectedly and fairly last-minute.

Qualifications: Those with previous field experience (especially those who
have bird-handling and/or behavioral observation experience) and a strong
interest in bird behavior are highly preferred, but such skills are not
absolutely necessary (indeed, I will train you with numerous field
protocols).

Other important qualifications include:

1) willingness to work very long hours in tropical conditions (that means
buggy, sweaty, and very wet),
2) commitment to paying attention to detail (e.g., writing legibly) for the
entire ~3.5 months of work,
3) ability to get along well with and be respectful of others in a very
cramped environment (you will be in close contact with myself and three to
four other field assistants for the whole 3.5 months, another PhD student
and his team of one or two people, a post-doc visiting for a month, and
occasional other visitors for varying lengths of time),
4) ability and willingness to work alone or jointly in the field and to
work in an area where encounters with venomous invertebrates are a real
possibility (there are plenty of bees, wasps, and ants; fortunately,
though, there are no venomous snakes),
5) good color vision (essential for distinguishing color-bands),
6) willingness to cook (we will prepare nearly all meals and share cooking
duties),
7) willingness to contribute to general upkeep of living quarters (e.g.,
cleaning dishes, sweeping and cleaning the house, locking up, etc.), and
8) an open mind, and a positive, pro-active attitude.
9) Spanish language competency is a big plus!
10) Applicants must have a strong interest in field research as a possible
or definite career goal (i.e., applying because you=A2d like to see a
tropical forest before going off to medical school is not something I=A2m
looking for).

Additional Desired Skills: I am especially interested in having assistants
with a strong background in botanical identification to help with
cataloguing woodpecker food items. Digital ornithology represents another
component of the work, including photo documentation of all captured birds.
I am interested in having assistants with strong photographing skills to
help collect and curate photographs.

Application instructions:

Please send:

1) a cover letter (1 page) detailing your interests and career goals and
how you see this internship fitting in with them,

2) a resume or CV (keep it to relevant details),

3) an unofficial transcript (or simple list of courses and grades on a
spreadsheet), and

4) the names and contact information (email and phone) of 3 references
(ideally with some experience with how you work in a research/field
context). Please also indicate the nature of your professional relationship
to EACH reference (e.g., field supervisor, academic advisor, professor for
a class, etc.).

PLEASE ONLY APPLY IF YOU DO NOT REQUIRE A STIPEND.
