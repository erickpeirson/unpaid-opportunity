Volunteer Field assistants – Sea turtle/primate research projects in Equatorial Guinea,
Africa.

Location Detail: Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, Africa.

Term of Appointment:
Oct 5, 2016 – Feb 28, 2017 (dates may vary by +2 days due to transportation availability)

Application Deadline: June 15th 2016

Job Description:
Indiana-Purdue University, Fort Wayne and the Bioko Marine Turtle Program are seeking
6 volunteers to assist with research and conservation projects on Bioko Island,
Equatorial Guinea. Field assistants will be based in research camps on the breathtaking
southern beaches of Bioko Island, and will participate in data collection on a number of
ongoing sea turtle and primate research projects. Field assistants will be expected to
devote at least 40 hrs/week to the program. Due to the nature of this field research and
the remote living conditions, hours are likely to exceed 40 hrs/wk. Volunteers are
encouraged to participate in all aspects of field research and conservation activities
including educational and outreach projects in nearby villages.

Sea turtle research is conducted nighty from 10pm - 4am and primate work will be
conducted during the day. Field assistants will alternate between working night and day
shifts and will walk an average of 10km/day. In addition, you will be expected to
participate in all daily operations and upkeep of the research camp. We will be living in
tents, cooking over an open fire, and using water from a nearby stream. Although a camp
cook will be present a few days a week, everyone will be responsible for participating in
activities such as meal preparation and cleanup, filtering water, starting and tending the
fire, etc.. There will be no electricity or refrigeration, which limits the variety and quantity
of perishable foods available. There is no internet or telephone connectivity available in
the field. A Satellite phone will be available in case of an emergency. The camp will have
one generator for charging research equipment, which may be used occasionally for
personal items (kindles, iPod, etc). Field assistants should be prepared for physically
demanding work and living conditions in a hot and humid climate.

This is an unpaid (volunteer) position but we do not charge program fees. We will provide
food, local transportation and other basic costs associated with living on the island
during the field season. Field assistants will be expected to provide international
transportation to and from Malabo, Equatorial Guinea (generally $1800-$2200 for a round
flight from US), medical and evacuation insurance, appropriate immunizations (please
contact a travel medicine doctor), medications (such as anti-malarial medication, etc.)
and personal camping gear. US citizens do not require a VISA to enter the country.

Qualifications:
-Field assistants should be at least 21 years old.
-An ability to get along with others in a communal living situation
-Prior field experience in biology, ecology or related disciplines.
-A desire to pursue a career in conservation biology/ecology is preferred.
-Spanish language ability: Spanish is the national language of Equatorial Guinea. Fluency
is not mandatory for this position, but is strongly preferred.
-Preference will be given to applicants with experience working in remote locations,
living in developing countries, or extensive experience camping and hiking in remote
wilderness areas.
-Physical fitness and a positive attitude will help as the combination of work and camp
life in this hot, humid environment can be physically exhausting
